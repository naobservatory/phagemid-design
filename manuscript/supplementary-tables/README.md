# Supplementary tables for the manuscript

Mike exported these from Google Drive ([private
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kd9x3E7gbwmGJL_yCdVm5X_KbUOeuqxy))
on 2023-12-23. Each table was original an Excel spreadsheet. In cases where the
Excel spreadsheet contained a single plane rectangular table, I exported a TSV
file. In other cases there was some other format or equations, so I exported
both the original Excel spreadsheet and a reformatted TSV version.

* Supplementary Table S1: Primer Sequences
  * [TSV file](./Supplementary Table S1 - Primer Sequences.tsv)
* Supplementary Table S2: Complete list of reagents, equipment, and suppliers  
  * [Excel file](./Supplementary Table S2 - Reagents Equipment and
    Suppliers.xlsx)
  * [TSV file](./Supplementary Table S2 - Reagents Equipment and Suppliers.tsv)
* Supplementary Table S3: Plasmid Maps
  * [TSV file](./Supplementary Table S3 - Plasmid Maps.tsv)
* Supplementary Table S4: Full Tracer Sequences
  * [TSV file](./Supplementary Table S4 - Full Tracer Sequences.tsv)
* Supplementary Table S5: Barcode Sequences and Components
  * [Excel file](./Supplementary Table S5 - Barcode Sequences and
    Components.xlsx); has three sheets, but the second and third sheets contain
    redundant information used for drafting the first sheet.
  * [TSV file](./Supplementary Table S5 - Barcode Sequences and Components.tsv)
    of first sheet
* Supplementary Table S6: Dilutions and concentrations for spike-in experiment
  * [Excel file](./Supplementary Table S6 - Spike-in Concentrations.xlsx)
  * [TSV file](./Supplementary Table S6 - Spike-in Concentrations.tsv)
